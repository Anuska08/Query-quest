## 📁 How to Use This Repository (Week 4 Final Project)

At **Code Social**, we believe learning should be *fun*, *hands-on*, and *creative*. So instead of boring textbook queries, we’ve created **three themed mini-projects** you can choose from:

- 🍿 `movies/`
- 🍔 `food_delivery/`
- 🍛 `biryani/`

You can complete **any one**, **any two**, or **all three** — depending on your prep level and curiosity. The goal is to apply what you’ve learned in a real-world (and fun!) way.
